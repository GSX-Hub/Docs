#FAQ
In this section we outline **what** and **how** you can contribute towards other creator profiles.

## Q: I want to help fix a problem(s) with a profile which I do not own
You can help fix problems that have been noted on the `Issues` tab and are marked with `up for grabs`. This means that the creator has indicated that they are happy for others to contribute / build upon their own work in return for *some* recognition.

!!! tip
    If an issue is **not** marked with `up for grabs`, any work submitted via a Pull Request will be promptly dismissed. Please check before you spend any time on it.
