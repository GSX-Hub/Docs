# Licensing
Licensing may sound daunting, but this page is here to make things clear about what you (the creator/contributor) are agreeing to when submitting your profile to GSXHub.

When uploading your profile, you have the flexibility to choose how your work is licensed. This ensures your preferences are respected while fostering collaboration within the GSXHub community.

***

## Default Licensing Options

You can choose from the following Creative Commons licenses for your work:

* [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/): Attribution required; noncommercial use only; modifications allowed.
* [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ): Attribution required; noncommercial use only; **no** modifications or derivative works allowed.

If no license is specified during upload, your profile will default to the **CC BY-NC 4.0** license to align with GSXHub's non-commercial, community-driven goals.

### In Short...

* **Credit:** Other users must credit you, the creator, always.
* **Restrictions:** All licenses are noncommercial and permit work to be copied and distributed.
* **Flexibility:** By allowing a range of licenses, **you** maintain control over how your work is used.
* **No Modifications Option:** If you do not want your work to be modified, you can choose the **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0** license.

## Submitting Content

When submitting or uploading your profile:

1. **Choose a License:** Specify your preferred license in the `Information.md` when uploading. If you're unsure, you can default to CC BY-NC 4.0.
2. **Agree to Collaboration (if applicable):** If your selected license allows modifications, you agree to let others update or adapt your work in line with that license.
3. **Ensure You Have Rights:** Only upload work you have created or have the rights to license.

## Removing Content

Should you wish to remove your content from GSXHub entirely, itâ€™s as simple as submitting a Pull Request (PR). Once the PR is approved and the cache expires, your content will no longer appear within the application.

Due to the nature of GitHub, deleted content will remain in the repository's history, but it will not be accessible within GSXHub.

## Why This Approach?

GSXHub operates on a non-profit basis, meaning we do not make revenue from profiles or the application. This is a project for the community, and there are no paywalls. Offering multiple licensing options ensures creators have control while promoting collaboration and transparency.
