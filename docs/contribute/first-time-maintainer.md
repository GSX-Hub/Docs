# First Time Maintainer
## Getting Started
Before we dive into editing anything, there are a few things you need to check first. </br>
Don't worry! We've explained everything you need to know below.

***

## Prerequisites

### License Check
Original creators have spent plenty of time publishing the profile, so before you begin to make any changes you need to check the profile's license.

#### Explained
There are two types of license:

| License | Description | 
| --- | ----------- |
| CC BY-NC 4.0 | Modifications Allowed |
| CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 | **NO** Modifications Allowed |

You are looking for `CC BY-NC 4.0` in order to have the green light for modifications.
Instead of searching through files, we've complied a list of available profiles and their respective licenses. See [Here]()

✅ If the profile you wish to update is listed as modifyable, then please continue [here](#modifyable)
❌ If it isn't, then please continue below...

***

### Not Modifyable
If you reached this point, it means that the creator has indicated that they wish to reserve any modifications.

You are now in the position to offer suggestions/improvements or report any bugs via the GSX Hub/Profiles GitHub Page.

To do so, please follow this [link](https://github.com/GSX-Hub/Profiles/issues/new/choose)
If you ask me, you may have dodged a bullet 😉 Profiles can be very tedious at times.

> Completed the form? 

Perfect! </br>
The creator may respond and ask for further details, so please keep an eye out.

*On behalf of the creators and GSX Hub, thank you for offering your support.*
